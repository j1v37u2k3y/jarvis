# JARVIS

**Just A Rather Very Intelligent System.**

A voice-first AI assistant that runs on your Mac. Talk to it, and it talks back -- with a British accent, dry wit, and
an audio-reactive particle orb straight out of the MCU.

JARVIS connects to your Apple Calendar, Mail, and Notes. It can browse the web, spawn Claude Code sessions to build
entire projects, and plan your day -- all through natural voice conversation.

## What It Does

- **Voice conversation** -- speak naturally, get spoken responses with a JARVIS voice
- **Builds software** -- say "build me a landing page" and watch Claude Code do the work
- **Reads your calendar** -- "What's on my schedule today?"
- **Reads your email** -- "Any unread messages?" (read-only, by design)
- **Browses the web** -- "Search for the best restaurants in Austin"
- **Manages tasks** -- "Remind me to call the client tomorrow"
- **Takes notes** -- "Save that as a note"
- **Remembers things** -- "I prefer React over Vue" (it remembers next time)
- **Plans your day** -- combines calendar, tasks, and priorities into a plan
- **Sees your screen** -- knows what apps are open for context-aware responses
- **Audio-reactive orb** -- a Three.js particle visualization that pulses with JARVIS's voice

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses AppleScript for Calendar, Mail, Notes integration)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Google Chrome** (required for Web Speech API)
- **Anthropic API key** -- powers the AI brain ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- **Fish Audio API key** -- powers the voice ([get one here](https://fish.audio/))
- **Claude Code CLI** -- for spawning dev tasks ([install here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code))

## Quick Start (with Claude Code)

The fastest way to get running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
claude
```

Claude Code will read the project's `CLAUDE.md` and walk you through setup step by step -- API keys, dependencies, SSL
certs, everything.

## Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
cd jarvis

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (see below)

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# 5. Generate SSL certificates (needed for secure WebSocket)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost'

# 6. (Optional but recommended) Install Mission Control for task delegation
git clone https://github.com/MeisnerDan/mission-control.git ~/IdeaProjects/mission-control
cd ~/IdeaProjects/mission-control/mission-control && pnpm install && cd -

# 7. Start JARVIS (starts MC, backend, and frontend in one command)
./jarvis

# 8. Open Chrome
open http://localhost:5173
```

Click the page once to enable audio, then speak. JARVIS will respond.

> **Note:** `./jarvis` starts Mission Control (if installed), the JARVIS backend, and the frontend together. Press
`Ctrl+C` to stop all of them. JARVIS works without Mission Control, but task delegation features will be unavailable.

### Mission Control Integration

JARVIS uses [Mission Control](https://github.com/MeisnerDan/mission-control) as its task management backbone. When you
say "add task X" or "build me Y", JARVIS creates a task in Mission Control, which then dispatches Claude Code via its
daemon to execute it. Agent reports come back through MC's inbox, and JARVIS speaks them to you.

- Mission Control UI: http://localhost:3000
- JARVIS UI: http://localhost:5173

**Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Clone Mission Control next to JARVIS
git clone https://github.com/MeisnerDan/mission-control.git ~/IdeaProjects/mission-control
cd ~/IdeaProjects/mission-control/mission-control

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Copy env template — an API token will be auto-generated on first run
cp .env.example .env
```

The `./jarvis` launcher will detect Mission Control at `~/IdeaProjects/mission-control/` and
start it automatically alongside the JARVIS backend and frontend. It also starts MC's daemon
process so tasks get dispatched to Claude Code.

### MCP Server Configuration

JARVIS spawns Claude Code sessions that can access MCP servers configured in a project-local
`.mcp.json` file. This file is **gitignored** because it contains local paths — each machine
needs its own.

Create `.mcp.json` at the repo root with any MCP servers you want available:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rick_mcp": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/your/mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

When JARVIS dispatches a Claude Code session from this directory, those MCP tools are
automatically available. Mention the server by name in your prompt (e.g., "use the rick_mcp
tools for this") and Claude will discover and invoke them.

#### Direct rick_mcp bridge (in-process)

In addition to the spawn-a-Claude-Code path above, JARVIS connects directly to `rick_mcp`
on startup so the voice loop can call rick tools as native Anthropic tool-use — no
subprocess round-trip. See `rick_bridge.py`.

- **8 tools voice-callable**: `rick_recon_handle`, `rick_cve`, `rick_cheatsheet`,
  `rick_mantra`, `rick_capabilities`, `rick_status`, `rick_threat_model`,
  `rick_tool_recommend`. Other rick tools (kill chain, full auto, tracker, career)
  remain available via the spawned-session path.
- **5 principle resources injected** into JARVIS's system prompt: `values`,
  `craftsmanship`, `heritage`, `mantras`, `summary`. JARVIS keeps its British butler
  voice but its judgments carry rick's foundation.
- **Configurable paths**: `RICK_MCP_PYTHON` and `RICK_MCP_PATH` env vars override the
  defaults (the rick venv + `rick_mcp.py`). If rick can't be reached at startup, the
  bridge stays disabled and JARVIS continues without it — security questions fall back
  to the spawn path automatically.

### Threat Model

JARVIS is designed for **single-user, localhost-only** operation:

- Server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default (set `--host 0.0.0.0` to expose, not recommended)
- Bearer token auth regenerated on every startup, accessible only via same-origin `/auth/token`
- CORS restricted to localhost origins
- No rate limiting — anyone with the auth token has full API access
- `ALLOW_DANGEROUS_PERMISSIONS=true` gives Claude Code full filesystem/shell access
- `ALLOW_REMOTE_CONTROL=true` enables the `/api/restart` and `/api/fix-self` endpoints
  (opt-in defense-in-depth even with valid auth)

If you expose JARVIS beyond localhost, you are responsible for adding TLS, auth hardening,
rate limiting, and network isolation.

## Configuration

Edit your `.env` file:

```env
# Required
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
FISH_API_KEY=your-fish-audio-api-key-here

# Optional -- your name (JARVIS will address you personally)
USER_NAME=Tony

# Optional -- specific calendar accounts (comma-separated)
# Leave empty to auto-discover all calendars
CALENDAR_ACCOUNTS=you@gmail.com,work@company.com

# Optional -- allow Claude Code to run with --dangerously-skip-permissions
# Enables full filesystem and command execution access for Claude Code sessions.
# Only enable if you trust the prompts being sent to Claude Code.
ALLOW_DANGEROUS_PERMISSIONS=true
```

## How the Voice Loop Works

1. You speak into your microphone
2. Chrome's Web Speech API transcribes your speech in real-time
3. The transcript is sent to the server via WebSocket
4. JARVIS detects intent -- conversation, action, or build request
5. For actions: spawns a Claude Code subprocess or runs AppleScript
6. Generates a response via Claude Haiku (optimized for speed)
7. Fish Audio converts the response to speech with the JARVIS voice
8. Audio streams back to the browser via WebSocket
9. The Three.js orb deforms and pulses in response to the audio
10. Background tasks notify you proactively when they complete

## Features in Detail

### Action System

JARVIS uses action tags to trigger real system actions:

- `[ACTION:BUILD]` -- spawns Claude Code to build a project
- `[ACTION:BROWSE]` -- opens Chrome to a URL or search query
- `[ACTION:RESEARCH]` -- deep research with Claude Opus, outputs an HTML report
- `[ACTION:PROMPT_PROJECT]` -- connects to an existing project via Claude Code
- `[ACTION:ADD_TASK]` -- creates a tracked task with priority and due date
- `[ACTION:REMEMBER]` -- stores a fact for future context

### Memory System

JARVIS remembers things you tell it using SQLite with FTS5 full-text search. Preferences, decisions, and facts persist
across sessions.

### Calendar & Mail

All macOS integrations use AppleScript -- no OAuth flows, no token management. Just native system access. Mail is
intentionally read-only for safety.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Some areas that could use work:

- **Linux/Windows support** -- replace AppleScript with cross-platform alternatives
- **Alternative TTS engines** -- add ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, or local models
- **Alternative LLMs** -- add OpenAI, Gemini, or local model support
- **Mobile client** -- a companion app for voice interaction on the go
- **Plugin system** -- make it easy to add new actions and integrations

Please open an issue before submitting large PRs so we can discuss the approach.
